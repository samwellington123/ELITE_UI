# Integration Onboarding

## FTP / Web Services

1. Email **sanmarintegrations@sanmar.com** with your request and **SanMar Customer Number**.  
2. Sign the **Integration Agreement** (no fee; must be an authorized signatory).  
3. After SanMar receives the signed agreement, **FTP and/or Web Services** access is typically enabled **within 1–2 business days**.  
4. You’ll receive access instructions and a secure link to your FTP credentials.  
   - **Note:** FTP credentials are **different** from Web Services credentials. Your **SanMar.com** username/password authenticate **PromoStandards & SanMar Web Service APIs** in production.

## Purchase Order (PO) Integration

1. After FTP/Web Services access is confirmed, request **PO integration**.  
2. SanMar provisions a **Test** environment account in **2–3 business days** and shares one-time Web Services credentials for Test.  
3. Complete testing using a **production-intent address** and submit an order with **multiple lines** (extra testing may apply for **PSST ship-via**).  
4. Email your **test PO number** to **sanmarintegrations@sanmar.com** for review and guidance.  
5. After successful testing, provide **username, shipping info, and payment method** to configure **production** PO processing (**~1–2 business days**).
