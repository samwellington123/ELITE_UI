# Shopify CSV – Overview

- **`sanmar_shopify.csv`** is produced daily with product information, MSRP, and inventory.  
- SanMar **does not** upload to your store; refer to Shopify docs & apps.  
- Known limits: **15 MB upload cap**, **100-variant maximum** per product; some image links may fail and block upload of that style.
