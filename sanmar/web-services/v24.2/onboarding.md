## Web Services Onboarding (summary)

1. Email **sanmarintegrations@sanmar.com** with your SanMar customer number.
2. Sign the integration agreement sent by SanMar.
3. After signature, **FTP and/or Web Services** access is provisioned (target **1–2 business days**). You’ll receive access instructions and a secure link for credentials.
4. **Credentials**: FTP creds are **separate**. For production web services, your **SanMar.com username/password** authenticates SanMar Standard and PromoStandards APIs.
5. To access **Test**: email Integration Support with your account number and reason; you’ll receive test credentials and instructions. Test systems can be intermittently unavailable.

## Purchase Order Integration (when ready)

- Request PO integration **after** you verify product data access.
- SanMar creates a **Test** account in **2–3 business days** and provides Web Services user credentials.
- Complete test order(s) (multiple lines; use your real production address). Additional testing may be required for **PSST** ship-via.
- Email your **test PO #** to Integration Support for review.
- After test pass, provide **username**, **shipping info**, and **payment method** for production configuration; provisioning target **1–2 business days**.

> See the *Integration Onboarding Flowchart* (page 6 of the PDF) for the full path from request → agreement → access → PO go-live.
